# Frogge NFTs
Frogge NFTs play a central role in the game, enabling their owners to actively participate by determining the costs of the services associated with their NFTs.

## Types of NFTs
There are three distinct types of Frogge NFTs:

1. **Islands**
2. **Homes**
3. **Sailing Ports**

## Islands
Scattered throughout the game map, a total of 88 islands are represented as NFTs. These islands serve as hubs for gameplay, where FRGE tokens randomly appear, providing players with opportunities to collect them. To access an island, players are required to pay a fee determined by the NFT's owner. Of the fee collected, 80% is directed to the wallet of the NFT owner, while the remaining 20% is allocated to the game's development and maintenance fund.

## Homes
Homes in the game provide a safe haven for both frogs and pirate frogs during their respective periods of vulnerability. Similar to islands, players must pay a fee to take refuge in a home, with the fee amount being decided by the owner of the NFT representing the home. A total of 100 homes are available, evenly split between frogs and pirate frogs.

## Sailing Ports
Facilitating exploration and travel, sailing ports enable players to embark on sailing boats and navigate to different islands on the map. As with islands and homes, players must pay a fee to the owner of the sailing port before setting sail. This fee allows players to access the navigation service and contributes to the NFT owner's earnings. It's important to note that each fee collected is divided in the same 80-20 split, benefiting both the NFT owner and the game's ongoing development.
